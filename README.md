# AgentNet

AgentNet is a sophisticated peer-to-peer networking framework that empowers distributed agents to communicate and share data with high efficiency. Leveraging Vulkan for graphics rendering, AgentNet is built for performance and scalability, providing a robust platform for decentralized agent interactions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Vulkan SDK
- CMake
- A C++ compiler like GCC or Clang

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgentNet.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd AgentNet
```

3. Create a build directory:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

4. Run CMake to configure the project:
```bash
cmake ..
```

5. Build the project:
```bash
cmake --build .
```

## Running the Tests

To run the automated tests for this system, use the following command:

```bash
ctest
```

## Deployment

For deployment, additional steps may be required, such as setting up a server environment or configuring network settings.

## Built With
